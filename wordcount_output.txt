“My 1
dear 1
Professor, 1
I’ve 1
never 1
seen 1
a 1
cat 1
sit 1
so 1
stiffly.” 1
“You’d 1
be 1
stiff 1
if 1
you’d 1
been 1
sitting 1
on 1
brick 1
wall 1
all 1
day,” 1
said 1
Professor 1
McGonagall. 1
“All 1
day? 1
When 1
you 1
could 1
have 1
celebrating? 1
I 1
must 1
passed 1
dozen 1
feasts 1
and 1
parties 1
my 1
way 1
here.” 1
McGonagall 1
sniffed 1
angrily. 1
“Oh 1
yes, 1
everyone’s 1
celebrating, 1
right,” 1
she 1
impatiently. 1
think 1
they’d 1
bit 1
more 1
careful, 1
but 1
no 1
— 1
even 1
the 1
Muggles 1
noticed 1
something’s 1
going 1
on. 1
It 1
was 1
their 1
news.” 1
She 1
jerked 1
her 1
head 1
back 1
at 1
Dursleys’ 1
dark 1
living-room 1
window. 1
“I 1
heard 1
it. 1
Flocks 1
of 1
owls 1
. 1
shooting 1
stars. 1
Well, 1
they’re 1
not 1
completely 1
stupid. 1
They 1
were 1
bound 1
to 1
notice 1
something. 1
Shooting 1

down 1
in 1

I’ll 1
bet 1
that 1
Dedalus 1
Diggle. 1
He 1
had 1

“You 1
can’t 1
blame 1
them,” 1
Dumbledore 1
gently. 1
“We’ve 1
precious 1
little 1
celebrate 1
for 1
eleven 1
years.” 1
know 1
that,” 1
irritably. 1
“But 1
that’s 1
reason 1
lose 1
our 1
heads. 1
People 1
are 1
being 1
downright 1
careless, 1
out 1
streets 1
broad 1
daylight, 1
dressed 1
Muggle 1
clothes, 1
swapping 1
rumors.” 1
threw 1
sharp, 1
sideways 1
glance 1
here, 1
as 1
though 1
hoping 1
he 1
tell 1
something, 1
didn’t, 1
went 1
“A 1

it 1

Dumbledore?” 1
“It 1
certainly 1
so,” 1
Dumbledore. 1
“We 1

Would 1

what 1
?” 1
drop. 1
They’re 1

“No, 1

coldly, 1
didn’t 1

“As 1

Dumbledore, 1

McGonagall, 1
sounding 1
half 1
exasperated, 1
admiring. 1
you’re 1
different. 1
Everyone 1
knows 1
only 1
one 1
oh, 1
right, 1
Voldemort, 1
flatter 1
me,” 1
calmly. 1
“Voldemort 1
powers 1
will 1
have.” 1
“Only 1
because 1
too 1
well 1

use 1
them.” 1
“It’s 1
lucky 1
it’s 1
dark. 1
haven’t 1
blushed 1
since 1
Madam 1
Pomfrey 1
told 1
me 1

shot 1

said, 1
“The 1

flying 1
around. 1
You 1
saying? 1
About 1
why 1
he’s 1

finally 1

reached 1
point 1
most 1

real 1

neither 1

however, 1

“What 1

McGonagall’s 1
